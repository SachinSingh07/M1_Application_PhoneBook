## About Phonebook Mini Project in C✒️

##### Phonebook is a very simple mini project in C that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling and data structure. This application will teach you how to add, list, modify or edit, search and delete data to/from the file.

##### Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application (as shown in the main menu screenshot below).

##### Personal information such as name, sex, father’s name, phone number, citizenship number, email and address are asked while adding a record into the Phonebook. These records can then be modified, listed, searched for and removed.
